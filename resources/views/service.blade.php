                    <h2>Tree Trimming vs Tree Pruning: What’s the Difference?</h2>
                    <p>We offer both tree trimming and tree pruning services in {Location}. While they both seem to be the
                        same, they hold some prominent differences.
                        <br>
                        Our Tree pruning involves cutting down dead, diseased, or weak tree branches that affect the overall
                        health of the tree. Its sole purpose is to improve the health of the tree, giving it more healthy
                        years to live.
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, our tree trimming service is concerned with trimming down overgrown branches that
                        either invade surrounding properties, pose damage to nearby structures, or negatively affect the
                        tree’s aesthetic look.

                                <p>Our crown reduction service is best preferred when a tree is bulky, increasing its chance
                                    of getting affected by storm damage. Crown reduction by our tree trimmers is focused on
                                    removing large tree branches located around the outer canopy of the tree. It also helps
                                    decrease the tree’s weight and allows more sunlight for surrounding landscaping.

                    <p>Most tree species grow in full form during spring and summer when they are also most susceptible to
                        diseases and pests. Our seasonal tree trimming in {Location} is best when the trees are dormant
                        during the winters, meaning they grow slowly and are prevented from diseases. We usually trim the
                        trees during winter, allowing them to grow healthily afterward.
                        <br>
                        However, when natural calamities such as storms are a risk, our dedicated tree arborists in
                        {Location} provide emergency tree service on a call. Our experts take prompt action in storm-related
                        trimming, minimizing the risk of damage caused by it.

                    <h2>Understanding Tree Trimming Costs in {Location}
                    </h2>
                    <p>Several factors influence our tree trimming costs in {Location} such as the tree species, size, and
                        condition of the tree. Some tree types such as oak and acacia have really strong branches, requiring
                        specialized cutting machinery and additional effort to trim. Tree trimming prices also depend on the
                        location where a tree is located. If a tree is really close to a powerline or a busy driveway, then
                        the cost to trim it is higher.
                        <br>
                        The average cost of tree trimming in {Location} is around $270 for small trees (10-20 ft) up to
                        $1,800 for large trees (60ft and beyond). The Tree Service Pros is known to offer the most
                        affordable prices to its clients. We offer special prices for multiple tree consignments and also
                        offer dedicated tree cutting service if a tree’s health is beyond recovery and cutting is found to
                        be the best option.
